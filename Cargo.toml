sniffglue is a network sniffer written in rust. Network packets are parsed \
concurrently using a thread pool to utilize all cpu cores. Project goals are \
that you can run sniffglue securely on untrusted networks and that it must \
not crash when processing packets. The output should be as useful as possible \
by default.\
